\title{Time-delay Embedding Lifting}
\usage{
lift_delay(X, delays = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix (n_vars x n_time).}

\item{delays}{Number of delay steps to include (default 2).}
}
\value{
Lifted matrix with dimensions (n_vars * (delays + 1)) x (n_time - delays).
Note: This reduces the number of usable time points.
}
\description{
Lifts state space by including time-delayed copies of the state.
This is useful for scalar time series or when dynamics depend on history.
}
\details{
For a scalar time series y(t), delay embedding creates:
\link{y(t), y(t-1), y(t-2), ..., y(t-delays)}

This is based on Takens' embedding theorem, which guarantees that
for a sufficient embedding dimension, the reconstructed state space
is diffeomorphic to the original attractor.
}
\examples{
y <- sin(seq(0, 4*pi, length.out = 50))
Y <- matrix(y, nrow = 1)
lifted <- RKoopmanDMD:::lift_delay(Y, delays = 3)
# Result has 4 rows and 47 columns
