\title{Reconstruct Training Data from DMD Model}
\usage{
dmd_reconstruct(object, n_steps = NULL, modes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{"dmd"} object.}

\item{n_steps}{Integer; number of time steps to reconstruct.
Default is the original number of time steps.}

\item{modes}{Integer vector; which modes to include in reconstruction.
Default is all modes. Use this to see contributions of specific modes.}
}
\value{
A matrix with the same dimensions as the training data
(or specified n_steps), representing the reconstructed time series.
}
\description{
Reconstructs the original time series using the DMD modes and
eigenvalues. Useful for assessing reconstruction accuracy and
understanding mode contributions.
}
\examples{
t <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)
X <- rbind(cos(t), sin(t))

model <- dmd(X)

# Full reconstruction
X_recon <- dmd_reconstruct(model)

# Reconstruction error
error <- sqrt(mean((X - X_recon)^2))
cat("RMSE:", error, "\n")

# Reconstruct using only first mode
X_mode1 <- dmd_reconstruct(model, modes = 1)
