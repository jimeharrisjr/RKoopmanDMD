\title{Forecast with Confidence Bounds (Experimental)}
\usage{
dmd_forecast(object, n_ahead = 10, x0 = NULL, level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{"dmd"} object.}

\item{n_ahead}{Number of time steps to forecast.}

\item{x0}{Initial state (optional).}

\item{level}{Confidence level (default 0.95 for 95\% bounds).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{fit}{Point predictions (matrix)}
\item{lower}{Lower confidence bound (matrix)}
\item{upper}{Upper confidence bound (matrix)}
\item{level}{Confidence level used}
}
}
\description{
Generates predictions with uncertainty estimates based on reconstruction
error from the training data.
}
\details{
This is an experimental feature. The confidence bounds are based on the
reconstruction error from the training data and assume that prediction
error grows proportionally with forecast horizon. More sophisticated
uncertainty quantification may be added in future versions.

t <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)
