    person("James", "Harris", , "jimeharrisjr@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) methods for analyzing
    and predicting dynamical systems using the Koopman operator framework.
    Provides tools to extract dominant spatiotemporal modes from data, analyze
    system stability through eigenvalue spectra, and forecast future states.
    Suitable for applications in fluid dynamics, climate science, neuroscience,
    and any field involving time-evolving systems.
